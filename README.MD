 Hello!

 Since this is just the repository my homepage you probably wanted to land <a href="https://shakespearegeek.github.io">here</a>.

 If you specifically got here from <a href="https://shakespearegeek.github.io/bardle">Bardle</a>:

 BARDLE is an obvious tribute to the original Wordle: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

 All I did was whip up a quick, domain specific version for Shakespeare people. All credit goes to the original designer of the game, and I wouldn't pretend to claim otherwise.
