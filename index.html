<div class="header h1">You're probably looking for <a href="/bardle">Bardle</a>, so let's go ahead and get that
link out of the way. Thanks for playing!</div>
<div class="header h3">About Shakespeare Geek</div>
<p class="lead">I am actually a programmer by trade, with over 30 years professional experience. If you're looking
for me because you want to talk about that side of my life, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duanemorin/">Linked In</a>
and <a href="https://www.jobcase.com/p/duane.morin?sharedFrom=copyLink&p_key=PvqMBJHsDq3jg-RwD2ToZw3H">Jobcase</a>. I am not currently
looking for new opportunities. But, as <a href="/bardle">Bardle</a> illustrates, I do like to dabble in the occasional side project.</p>
<p class="lead">If on the other hand you want to talk about Shakespeare, well, then, I'll talk your ear off.
  <a href="http://www.shakespearegeek.com/blog">ShakespeareGeek.com</a> was started way back in 2005 because I couldn't
  find enough people to talk about Shakespeare with. I like to call it the "original" Shakespeare blog, because seriously,
  I went hunting for Shakespeare blogs. There weren't any. Until I came around.</p>
<p class="lead">Yes, I'm aware that saying blog is like saying MySpace, but I just can't bear to get rid of it. You write all the content for
a site for 15 years and then think about shutting it down. It ain't easy, let me tell you. Whenever I have original artwork or photos (like
when I attend a show), I go to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shakespearegeek/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p class="lead">You're far more likely to find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ShakespeareGeek">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ShakespeareGeekDotCom">Facebook</a>
  these days.  I'd like to be more active on Instagram, but Shakespeare's really more about the text, if you ask me. I can't see throwing the
  text only a random piece of background clipart just so I can put it on Instagram. </p>
<div class="header h3">Other Links</div>
<p class="lead">I wrote a book! <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ct3VPa">Hear My Soul Speak : Shakespeare for Weddings</a> is a collection of material
  from Shakespeare's work that can be used in all aspects of a wedding from what to say in the vows and the best man's toast to what to write in
  the guest book.<p>
<p class="lead">There's also merch!  We got tired of seeing the same old Shakespeare jokes on t-shirts and decided to make a line of our own.
  Our stuff's focused on original material and inside jokes that only true Shakespeare fans are likely to get. If you're primarily looking for
  t-shirts (and similar clothing), I'm going to point you to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A7141123011%2Cp_4%3AShakespeare+Geek&ref=bl_sl_s_ap_web_7141123011">Amazon</a>.
  If you're looking for more random stuff - think stickers, mouse pads, tote bags, etc... - then I'm going to send you to <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/ShakespeareGeek/shop?asc=u">Redbubble<a>.
  I take requests!</p>
<div class="header h3">One More Thing</div>
<p class="lead">If all else fails, and you just want to contact me directly, I'm happy to hear from you.
  Freel free to <a href="mailto:duane@shakespearegeek.com">email me</a>!</p>
<p class="lead">Thanks for reading this far, and have a nice day.</p>
